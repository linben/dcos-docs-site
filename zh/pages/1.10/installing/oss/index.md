DC/OS can be installed on any cluster of physical or virtual machines.

# [Local Installation](/1.10/installing/oss/local/)

For first-time users or developers looking to build services or modify DC/OS, the [Vagrant installer](/1.10/installing/oss/local/) provides a quick, free way to deploy a virtual cluster on a single machine.

# [Cloud Provisioning](/1.10/installing/oss/cloud/)

For users deploying to the public cloud, DC/OS offers configurable cloud provisioning templates for [AWS](/1.10/installing/oss/cloud/aws/) and [Azure](/1.10/installing/oss/cloud/azure/) that will manage virtual machines and DC/OS installation.

DC/OS can be installed on other public and private clouds using the Datacenter Installation process, provided virtual machines and networks are created first.

# [Custom Installation](/1.10/installing/oss/custom/)

For new users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises or in the cloud, the [GUI Installer](/1.10/installing/oss/custom/gui/) provides a guided experience for bootstrapping a DC/OS cluster.

For advanced users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises or in the cloud, the [Advanced Installer](/1.10/installing/oss/custom/advanced/) provides a scriptable, automatable interface to integrate with your preferred configuration management system.
